# Project: Self evolving site

## General Instructions:

- When updating the index.html file, always preserve the footer with the time for the upcoming site updates.
- Strictly generate only the raw HTML content, beginning with `<!DOCTYPE html>` and ending with `</html>`. 
- The output must not contain any prose, explanations, or comments. 
- Your entire response must be a single block of pure HTML code. Only output the HTML content itself, no comments, no explanations, nothing additional.
