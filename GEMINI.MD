# Project: Self evolving site

## General Instructions:

- When updating the index.html file, always preserve the footer with the time for the upcoming site updates.
- Strictly generate only the raw HTML content, beginning with `<!DOCTYPE html>` and ending with `</html>`. 
- The output must not contain any prose, explanations, or comments. 
- Your entire response must be a single block of pure HTML code. Only output the HTML content itself, no comments, no explanations, nothing additional.

## Instructions for ensuring permanent page structure

- It should always have a footer with time to next update. 
- The time to next self AI update should be calculated by current client time basing on the fact that it updates every begining of each hour and takes a couple of minutes. Don't show the time for 5 minutes of the beginning of each hour.
